# Python Playground - Rolling the dice

Small little project to get python up and running

## Description

Created a python game which rolls a "dice" and generates a random number. Next step, is to add a user input asking the user if they want to play again and based on answer "yes / no" it will either roll the dice again or exit the programme

## How to run

- Have Python installed
- Clone the project and run `npm install`
- Open the `diceRoll.py`, right click and `Run Python file in terminal`
